## Abstract
Consumer complaints are a critical aspect of business operations, reflecting customer satisfaction levels and highlighting areas for improvement. Traditional complaint resolution methods often suffer from inefficiencies, resulting in delayed responses and heightened consumer frustration. We propose a machine learning-driven approach for Consumer Complaint Resolution Analysis to address this issue. Our project focuses on automating the complaint classification and prioritization process, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from complaint texts. By collecting and pre-processing complaint data from various sources, including consumer forums and social media platforms, we aim to develop robust models capable of categorizing complaints based on product/service type and issue severity. Through feature engineering and model training, we intend to deploy a scalable system capable of real-time complaint processing and resolution prioritization. This project seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of complaint resolution processes, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and fostering stronger consumer-company relationships.
